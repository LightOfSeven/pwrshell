### NetwrixScript for enabling File Servers to work with Netrix Auditor. Windows Server 2012 and above.
### User variable is which user/group of users you want to monitor for changes, not who has read access!
### Script seeks for hidden and visible SMB Shares and adds the requested permissions, unless it is an Administrative share - also starts RemoteRegistry and sets to Automatic start
### Use the -verbose switch on the ps1 script in order to show verbose errors
### Accompanying GPO also required for Windows Firewall, Services and Audit Policy settings

$folders = Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Share | Where-Object {($_.name -notlike 'C$' -and $_.name -notlike 'ADMIN$') -and $_.name -notlike 'IPC$'}

### You can specify the domain, otherwise the current group/accounts's domain is used. e.g. domain\username
$user = "Everyone"
Write-verbose "$user is selected as group to monitor"

### Switch will allow the user to choose the mode used for auditing.
### Refer to Configure Object-Level Access Auditing documentation for further information.
